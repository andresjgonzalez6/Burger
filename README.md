# Burger
Handle your burger with these bars, Handlebars that is. Also some lovehandles.

* This project is an example of a full stack web application. The front end is handlebars, and is live updated with user inputs of their burger preferences. 

* The back end is a mysql database that is updated with orm functions. 

* Currently, the website is not working. I am having trouble getting the handlebars file to actually show up on the browser. The server host works, and the server is communicating with the database, but there is nothing being displayed.
